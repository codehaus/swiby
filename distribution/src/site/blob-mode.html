<title>Blob Mode</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>Swiby in blob mode is the same as Adobe's Flash technology - a large mostly self-contained application archive will  downloaded into an embed portion of a web page.  The application once launched may communicate with the backend server in usual AJAX type functions.</p>
<p>It can also run from the desktop as a standalone application without being inside a browser frame.</p>
<p>( still a work in progress )</p>
