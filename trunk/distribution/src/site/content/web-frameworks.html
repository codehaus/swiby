<p>We are agnostic as to which technology you use to generate Swiby pages on the server side. Oviously Swiby is not processing HTML, so no technology that is tied to HTML is going to work.</p>
<p>We are imagining templating technologies like <a href="http://freemarker.org/">Freemarker</a> and <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/">Velocity</a> are going to be the sweetspot.</p>
<p>The server technologies in question need to be able to render swiby pages, set the mime type to &quot;text/swiby&quot; and deal with incoming GET and POST operations from the browser. </p>
