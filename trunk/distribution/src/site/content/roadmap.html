<h2>Two directions</h2>
<p>Formal Tasks are spcified in our <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/SWIBY">Issue Tracking</a> </p>
<h3>Standalone</h3>
<p>With an appropriate file suffix and an association to a Swiby launcher, as zipped up application can run on the desktop by being double clicked, or in a web page just like Flash applications.</p>
<h3>The Sweb</h3>
<p>The web server hosts a Swiby application to a browser. The browser either natively or via plugin support swiby pages and renders them in a way that is very familiar to users of the the web.</p>
<p>Swiby pages -</p>
<ul>
  <li> are either static on the web server or part of a dynamic application ( think Ruby on Rails or Waffle making Swiby pages instead of HTML+JS )<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>have flow control - the eqivalent of &lt;a href=&quot;nextpage.html&quot;&gt;next page&lt;/a&gt; will exist as a function on a 'context' object that is in scope. It implicitly causes the current page to be exited.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>being text over the wire, are indexable by search engines (assuming an upgraded to be able to parse them).<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>like web pages,  have a low startup and upgrade cost for end-users<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>unline web pages, are a single language (Ruby) rather than two (HTML + JavaScript)</li>
</ul>
