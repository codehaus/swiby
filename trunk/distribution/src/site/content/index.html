<h2>What is Swiby?</h2>

<p>Swiby is a blend of Swing and Ruby for truly rich distributed applications.</p>
<p>If is aiming to be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>as editable as possible in a design tool like DreamWeaver</li>
  <li>as functional as Adobe's Flash, Microsoft's Silverlight and Sun's JavaFX</li>
  <li>embedable as a binary in a web page (like the movie players in YouTube.com)</li>
  <li>a cannot-get-any-richer page technology via browser plugin, as an alternate to HTML+Javascript</li>
  <li>a single language as opposed to two-language compromises like HTML+Javascript (refer <a href="glass-ceiling.html">glass ceiling</a>)</li>
  <li>indexable by Google (or your favorite search engine)<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Swing?</h3>
<p>Swing is an incredibly sophisticated UI technology for Java that can that can meet all your UI needs. Applications like JetBrain's Intellij IDEA are built on it.</p>
<h3>Why Ruby?</h3>
<p>Ruby is an interpreted language that is very adaptable and capable. It has been popularised by Ruby on Rails in recent years, its proving that <strong>less is more</strong> for web application development. We want the same gains for 'The Sweb' so we have defined a builder-like style for the marking up of Swiby pages. This style of page will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>be editable by non-programmers</li>
  <li>allow the builder style to be broken out of for advanced functionality</li>
  <li>be editable by design tools, with round-trip capability</li>
</ul>
<p>Ruby, or more accurately JRuby will be fast to interpret each page that it processes. The is no compile stage that may invisibly slow rendering down.</p>
