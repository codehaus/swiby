<h3>Jean Lazarou</h3>
<p>Jean first demonstrated Swiby in January 2007, writing it in pure JRuby. He modelled it initially after JavaFX (then known as 'F3') but knew that there's competitors in Adobe's Flash/Flex/AIR as well as Microsoft's Silverlight.</p>
<h3>Paul Hammant</h3>
<p>Paul works for ThoughtWorks in the USA. He's been interested in a builder like language leveraging Swing for web usage for a number of years. In 2004, he started 'Thicky' but is happier with JRuby intead of Groovy, hence that's not developed anymore, and he's on Jean's Swiby project.</p>
