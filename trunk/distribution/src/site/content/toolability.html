<title>Toolability</title>
</head>
<body>
UI technologies are divided into two camps. Those that are toolable, and those that are not.<br />
<h3>Some definitions</h3>
<p><em>Untoolable UI technologies, telltale signs -</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Developers are controling or even designing UI code.</li>
  <li>Design professionals hand versions of the UI to developers. Developers to transcode  from the designers preferred technology into the source of the application</li>
  <li>Breaking the UI into fragments of source and using 'include' at runtime to build a large UI, figures in its architecture</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Toolable UI technologies</em></p>
<ul><li>Designers work in a tool that is compatible with the source of the application</li>
<li>Developers take the resulting source, and without transcoding it, add functionality to turn it into an application</li></ul>
<p><em>Roundtrip toolable User interfaces</em></p>
<ul><li>As toolable but the the designer in a design tool and the developer can take it in turns to edit the UI source to the application</li></ul>
<h3>Swiby?<br />
</h3>
<p>Swiby aims to be a round-trip toolable technology. The builder-syntax lends itself to toolability, and if the tool is smart it will preserve closures that it does not understand.</p>
