<title>Blob Mode</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>Swiby in blob mode is  similar to the distribution model for Adobe's Flash technology or Java Applets - a large mostly self-contained application archive will  downloaded into an embed portion of a web page.  The application, once launched, may communicate with the backend server with the usual AJAX style functions.</p>
<p>It can also run from the desktop as a standalone application without being inside a browser frame.</p>
<p>( still a work in progress )</p>
