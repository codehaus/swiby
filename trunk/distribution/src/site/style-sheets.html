<title>Style Sheets</title>

<body>
<p>Like HTML, swiby has a style sheet concept. It works in a very similar way, but is a lot more powerful.</p>
<p>Consider the unstyled and styled versions of a 'transfer form' :</p>
<p><img src="images/unstyled_transferform.jpg" alt="unstyled" width="428" height="344" /><img src="images/styled_transferform.jpg" alt="styled" width="428" height="338" /></p>
<p>The only difference between the two is the presence of the following at the top of the swiby page:</p>
<div class="source">
<pre>
  require 'styles'</pre>
</div>
<p>The stylesheet itself (styles.rb) would look like:</p>
<div class="source">
<pre>
  styles {
    root(
      :font_family => Styles::VERDANA,
      :font_style => :normal,
      :font_size => 10
    )
    label(
      :font_style => :italic,
      :font_size => 12,
      :color => 0xAA0000
    )
    input(
      :font_family => Styles::COURIER,
      :font_style => :normal,
      :font_size => 12,
      :background_color => 0xFFFFC6
    )
    button(
      :font_weight => :bold
    )
  }
</pre>
</div>
<p>The current implementation is quite simple. We are going to allow the matching by class. What is a plus is that this is a ruby script - you are going to be able to do leverage simple things like variables used multiple times, and custom functions if you want to (its Turing complete, not just a list of values).</p>
