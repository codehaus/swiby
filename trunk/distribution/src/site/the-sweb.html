<title>'The Sweb'</title></head>

<body>
<p>&quot;The Sweb&quot; is a name for <em>The Swing Web</em>.</p>
<p>The premise is that instead of HTML and JavaScript there a Swiby page (Jruby describing a Swing view).</p>
<p>Swiby pages-</p>
<ul>
  <li> are either static on the web server or part of a dynamic application ( think Ruby on Rails or Waffle making Swiby pages instead of HTML+JS )<br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li>have flow control - the eqivalent of &lt;a href=&quot;nextpage.html&quot;&gt;next page&lt;/a&gt; will exist as a function on a 'context' object that is in scope. Invocation of approprate functions on the context object, implicitly causes the current page to be exited.<br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li>being text over the wire, are indexable by search engines (assuming an upgraded to be able to parse them).<br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li>like web pages,  have a low startup and upgrade cost for end-users<br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li>unline web pages, are a single language (JRuby) rather than two (HTML + JavaScript)</li>
</ul>
