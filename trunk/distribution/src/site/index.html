    Intranet applications</strong>!</p>
</div>
<p>Swiby is a blend of Swing and Ruby for truly rich distributed applications.</p>
<p>It is aiming to be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a truly rich client-side page technology via a browser plugin - think lazy-loaded Flash (see '<a href="web-mode.html">web - mode</a>')</li>
  <li>alternatively embedable as a big-up-front-download in a web page - much like the movie players in YouTube (see '<a href="blob-mode.html">blob mode</a>')</li>
  <li>as editable as possible in design tools like DreamWeaver (see <a href="toolability.html">toolability</a>)</li>
  <li>as functional as Adobe's Flash, Microsoft's Silverlight and Sun's JavaFX</li>
  <li>a single language as opposed to two-language compromises like HTML+Javascript (refer <a href="glass-ceiling.html">glass ceiling</a>)</li>
  <li>indexable by Google (or your favorite search engine)<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Swing?</h3>
<p>Swing is an incredibly sophisticated UI technology for Java that can meet all your UI needs. Applications like <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">JetBrain's Intellij IDEA</a> are built on it. There are other complimentary technologies like Java2D that are highly complementary to Swing.</p>
<h3>Why Ruby?</h3>
<p>Ruby is an interpreted language that is very adaptable and capable. It has been popularised by Ruby on Rails in recent years, its proving that <strong>less is more</strong> for web application development. We want the same gains for 'The Sweb' so we have defined a builder-like style for the marking up of Swiby pages. This style of page will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>be editable by non-programmers</li>
  <li>allow the builder style to be broken out of for advanced functionality</li>
  <li>be editable by design tools, with round-trip capability</li>
</ul>
<p>Ruby, or more accurately JRuby will be fast to interpret each page that it processes. The is no compile stage that may invisibly slow rendering down.</p>
<p>Sun's <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javafx/script/">JavaFX Script</a> technology is closest to Swiby.</p>
<h3>Sample Swiby Web Application</h3>
<p>Jean started a simple bank-account application. Its has Transfers Lists and the ability to make new transfers. There is no server side yet, but it will gove you a glimpse of the pseudo-declarative form that is easy for newbies to code. The source for the app is three ruby scripts (<strong>click on each image to see the source</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Transfers List ..</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://svn.codehaus.org/swiby/trunk/core/demo/banking/banking.rb"><img src="images/transfers.jpg" width="554" height="595" alt="transfers image"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Transfer ..</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://svn.codehaus.org/swiby/trunk/core/demo/banking/transfer_form.rb"><img src="images/new-transfer.jpg" width="554" height="595" alt="transfer image"/></a></p>
<p>The client-side model, not a Swiby page per se, is <a href="http://svn.codehaus.org/swiby/trunk/core/demo/banking/bank_model.rb"> here</a></p>
<h2>Trying it out</h2>
<p>Best to do this direct from Subversion. In a command shell:</p>
<pre>  svn co http://svn.codehaus.org/swiby/trunk/core<br />  cd core<br />  jruby -Iswiby demo/banking/banking.rb

Requires JRuby installed and 'jruby' in your PATH</pre>
<h2>Getting involved</h2>
<p>It is quite early days for the project.  Nothing is useable in any serious way yet, and we have a ton of work to do. However if you're a swing loving Ruby convert or a C++ person with a like of writing browser plugins think about helping us.  The <a href="http://xircles.codehaus.org/projects/swiby">management app</a> for Codehaus projects shows you where the mail lists and issue tracker are. We're looking forward to patches in advance of taking committers on :-)</p>
